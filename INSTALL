A C compiler is required, e.g. GCC. Requires CMake 3.0 if building with CMake (recommended).

Requires the NASA CDF C Library and the UCalgary TIIM EFI TII Level 0 processing C library.

Compile and run on a unix operating system.

Both libraries are installed when building a docker image using the Docker/docker-build.sh script.

$ git clone https://github.com/Swarm-DISC/TRACIS
$ mkdir -p TRACIS/build
$ cd TRACIS/build
$ cmake ..
$ make install

This will put the binary tracis in your $HOME/bin directory.
